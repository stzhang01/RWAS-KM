RWAS-KM: Novel Regulome-Wide Association Study Algorithm to Identify Key Regulatory Elements in Dissecting the Genetic Landscape of Cancer.

## Instructions
RWAS can be divided into two steps: the training step and the prediction step. The core of RWAS is the prediction of the chromatin accessibility using genetic variants, associating these predictions with phenotype. RWAS-KM employs either a linear model or marginal effect analysis for the initial feature selection, guided by the chromatin accessibility signals. This integrated approach promises more accurate and reliable identification of accessibility peaks and functional interpretations, deepening our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underpinning various cancers. Initially, leveraging insights from existing RWAS, we selected and assigned weights to a set of genetic variants. These weights were determined based on their correlation with RWAS peak expressions, utilizing either lasso weights derived from RWAS or marginal effects calculated for each SNP. In the second step, we employed a kernel machine to aggregate these weighted variants, subsequently constructing an association score test.<br><br>
